### About myself

I started learning programming on the 1st of November 2021 and at the time I didn't have any programming background. In finding myself, I was find my favorite pastime. I liked the feeling that I could solve the problems associated with development, and I decided that I wanted to do it professionally.<br>_I haven’t programmed for almost a year and now I’ve decided to try my second attempt at this world of wonders._
